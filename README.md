# go-bindings-microsoft-ui-xaml

Go bindings for **WinUI 3** and the rest of the [Windows App
SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/) — the
`Microsoft.*` namespaces — so a Windows desktop application with a native user
interface can be written in Go.

No Visual Studio, no .NET SDK, no XAML compiler, no cgo. Just `go build`.

> **Status: early.** The generator is not written yet. See
> [Where this is](#where-this-is) for what works today and what does not.

## The family

This is the fifth of a set of Go binding generators that share one approach:
metadata in, deterministic Go out, with CI checking that regenerating produces
exactly what is committed.

| Repository | Metadata source | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| [go-winmd](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/go-winmd) | — | the shared ECMA-335 `.winmd` reader |
| [go-bindings-win32](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/go-bindings-win32) | `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Win32Metadata` | the Win32 surface, and the COM/WinRT ABI beneath everything else |
| [go-bindings-wdk](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/go-bindings-wdk) | `microsoft/wdkmetadata` | the driver-kit surface |
| [go-bindings-winrt](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/go-bindings-winrt) | `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts` | the `Windows.*` WinRT namespaces |
| **this repository** | **`Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`** | **the `Microsoft.*` namespaces: WinUI 3, windowing, notifications, app lifecycle** |

Each layer builds on the ones above it. This repository does not re-implement
activation, strings, delegates or collections — go-bindings-winrt already does
all of that, and its types are used directly.

## What makes this different from the others

The repositories above project metadata that ships with Windows. The Windows
App SDK does not: it is a separately versioned redistributable, and that
changes three things.

**The metadata comes from NuGet, split across packages.**
`Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK` is a meta-package with nine components, and the
winmds live under `metadata/` inside them — `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.winmd` in the
WinUI component, twenty more in Foundation.

**The types are not registered with the operating system.**
`RoGetActivationFactory` cannot find `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window` the way it
finds `Windows.Globalization.Calendar`. An application that is not packaged
has to add the Windows App SDK framework package to its own process first, by
calling `MddBootstrapInitialize2` from a DLL it ships beside the executable.
That DLL is not already on the machine; it exists only in the NuGet package.

**XAML has thread affinity.** It requires a single-threaded apartment and
keeps its state per UI thread, so that thread has to be locked and initialized
before anything is activated. Work arriving from any other goroutine has to be
posted to it through a `DispatcherQueue`.

The groundwork for the third point is already released. go-bindings-winrt
v0.4.0 added per-thread apartment initialization, an opt-in for running
callbacks on the thread that invoked them, and zero-parameter delegates —
without which `DispatcherQueue.TryEnqueue` could not be called at all.

## Where this is

Nothing is generated yet. What exists is the module, its pinned dependencies,
and a test proving the layers compose at the versions pinned: it activates a
real WinRT class, checks that apartment initialization is per thread, and
reaches the ABI foundation.

The order of work, and why:

| | Milestone | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Module, dependencies, CI | ← you are here |
| **M1** | **Feasibility spike** | Hand-written Go that puts a real WinUI 3 window on screen. |
| M2 | `fetch-metadata` | Resolve the nine-package fan-out; download the winmds and the bootstrapper. |
| M3 | `ingest` | winmds → committed JSON, with `Windows.*` references resolved against go-bindings-winrt. |
| M4 | `bindings` | JSON → Go. |
| M5 | Runtime layer | Bootstrapping, apartment control, the application loop. |
| M6 | Deriving from WinRT classes | Needed for custom controls; requires work in go-bindings-winrt first. |
| M7 | Hardening | Slot and IID checks, docs, automated metadata updates. |

M1 is a gate rather than a step. Everything after it depends on questions only
it can answer, so it comes before any generator work: if a Go executable
cannot bootstrap the Windows App SDK and obtain a working `Application`, the
approach needs rethinking — and that is much better learned from a few hundred
lines than after building a generator.

## Requirements

- Windows, **amd64 only**. arm64 is excluded deliberately; see
  [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#architecture-support).
- Go 1.25 or newer.
- The Windows App SDK runtime, at run time. Nothing extra is needed to build.
